Please be sure you include all the relevant information in your issue so we can help you:

- [ ] What steps where taken to reproduce your issue?
- [ ] What are your configuration file(s), where relevant?
- [ ] If it's a problematic ES query, then have you tested it directly
      with the [official PHP client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php)?
      Remember, this package is basically just a configuration helper that wraps the
      official client.  If it doesn't work there, then the issue isn't with my package.
- [ ] Is there any other code we might need to see in order to help?

Please use a descriptive title for your issue.  "Why doesn't this work?" doesn't provide
other users much information if they are scanning the list of issues.

Also, *please* use [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)
when pasting more than one line of code.  It makes it so much more readable for everyone!

**Thank you!**
